Overview: Developed a production-ready multi-container application leveraging modern web technologies, containerization, and cloud deployment. The project integrates a React frontend, Express backend, background worker, and Nginx reverse proxy, with Postgres and Redis databases for persistence and caching.

Key Features & Architecture:

    Frontend: React container delivering a responsive client interface.

    Backend: Express.js container serving APIs and business logic.

    Worker: Dedicated container for background jobs and asynchronous task processing.

    Reverse Proxy: Nginx container managing routing, load balancing, and request handling.

    Databases: Postgres (structured data) and Redis (caching, session management) pulled directly from Docker Hub.

    Orchestration: Docker Compose used to define and run the multi-container environment.

    CI/CD: Travis CI integrated for automated builds and testing.

    Cloud Deployment: AWS Elastic Beanstalk used to orchestrate and deploy containers via Dockerrun.aws.json.

Skillsets Demonstrated:

    Full-stack development (React, Express.js).

    Containerization & orchestration (Docker, Docker Compose).

    Database management (Postgres, Redis).

    Reverse proxy configuration (Nginx).

    CI/CD pipeline automation (Travis CI).

    Cloud deployment & scaling (AWS Elastic Beanstalk).

    Systems design & distributed architecture.

Impact: Delivered a scalable, cloud-hosted application showcasing end-to-end ownership — from coding and containerization to automated testing and deployment. Demonstrated ability to build resilient, production-ready systems in a startup-style environment.
